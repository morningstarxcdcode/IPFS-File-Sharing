# IPFS-File-Sharing

A decentralized file sharing application built on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) that enables secure, peer-to-peer file storage and sharing with a fast, modern React and Vite-based user interface.

## Why IPFS-File-Sharing?

Traditional file sharing methods often rely on centralized servers, which can be slow, expensive, and vulnerable to censorship or failure. IPFS-File-Sharing leverages the power of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to create a decentralized, resilient, and efficient file sharing network that empowers users to share files directly with peers without relying on intermediaries.

## Features

- Decentralized peer-to-peer file sharing using IPFS
- Secure and private file storage
- Fast and modern user interface built with React and Vite
- Easy file upload and download
- Support for sharing files with multiple peers
- Open source and extensible
